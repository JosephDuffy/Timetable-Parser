Timetable Parser
===

Timetable Parser is a small io.js application that will fetch and parse timetable information from the University of Huddersfield's timetable system.

The reason for its creation is 2 fold:
 - To allow students to easily download/parse their timetable information
 - To highlight the securitry concerns of having the timetable data publicly (with little effort) accessable
